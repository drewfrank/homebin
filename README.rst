==============================================
homebin: a collection of useful shell scripts.
==============================================

What is it
==========

Over the years I've collected and written a few handy command-line tools that 
I've grown accustomed to. Most of these are shell scripts with minimal 
dependencies so they should mostly "just work" on any machine you copy them to.

I like to keep these scripts in \~/bin, hence the name.

Summary of tools
================
pyinit
    Creates the skeleton for a new Python package in the current 
    directory.
scd
    Changes the "current directory" of the active screen session to the 
    current directory
